				Collection by Kimaya Sarin <span id="hide">As someone who has always been drawn to maps, I used that as a starting point for this collection. I wanted to explore the ways in which we see the world around us, the representations we have created over time and how we interact with our surroundings. This is multi-media collection explores how maps are always subjective, they are representations created by us, revealing internal perspectives.</span>
